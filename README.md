# hello-luke-java
This is project dedicated for NA/NLA pairing and guiding NLA in his learning as he ventures past K-12 and towards university.  One of the happiest times in my life is when you asked "Can you teach more about programming?".  So, our journey begins.

## Goals
* (NLA) we should define goals, without goals we can not measure progress.  I will set a path, but you need to walk it and make you own way to your best self.

## Guidelines
(NLA)  
This is your "anchor project".  Other projects are used to support learning here and eventually you will move in parallel, once you have a strong core and foundations.  To start, we will adventure using Java as a core base language and compare and contrast two other languages C# and Python.

I am dividing them into 4 categories: 1) basic, 2) intermediate, 3) advanced, 4) go pro

## Tools, etc.
We will start all exercises using small and simple projects.  These projects will use just a stand alone "console" program with simple main() entry point before introducing too much other "stuff".  However, the goal is to get past this and to start building full applications using more complex architectures.

### Basic
These projects are based on what we explore step by step, question by question and not specifically directed but show your personal journey and evolution.  I asked around on what core CS fundamentals should be covered first.

- NOTE: I need to add our original C# project with your original questions for tracking.

* [hello-luke-csharp](https://github.com/nalbarr/hello-luke-csharp "C# anchor project")

* [hello-luke-python](https://github.com/nalbarr/hello-luke-python "Python anchor project")

### Intermediate
You may find these handy.  This are *katas* I like to use when learning new languages.

It often helps to start with something basic and familiar.  It also helps you compare and contrast languages across different dimensions as we have learned together (e.g., static vs. dynamic/intepreted, strong and weak typing).  You will see I use hello-shapes-<lang> as a baseeline for basic abstract shape, concrete class as Triangle and Square and how to polymorph "getArea" behavior as an algorithm.  

* NOTE:  I am  including a "hybrid" language of Scala that includes both object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming (FP) paradigms.

* NOTE:  I am avoiding too much hyper focused on Javascript.  It is popular but I do not think is forced good thinking and development early - you need to appreciate more basic CS concepts beforehand.

* NOTE:  Add KL/NA debate on OOP vs. FP.

Also, I added some puzzles we have worked through together (e.g., Einstein puzzle).

* [hello-shapes-csharp] TBD.

* [hello-shapes-python](https://github.com/nalbarr/hello-shapes-python "Python shapes project")

* [hello-shapes-scala](https://github.com/nalbarr/hello-shapes-scala "Scala shapes project")
NOTE: supporting course as [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://github.com/nalbarr/coursera-epfl-funprog-scala)

* [hello-shapes-clj](https://github.com/nalbarr/hello-shapes-clj "Clojure shapes project")

### Some toy problems and puzzles we have done together
#### Einstein puzzle

  - NOTE:  supporting course at [Data Science Specialization (using R)](https://github.com/nalbarr/coursera-johnhopkins-datascience)

### Advanced
(NLA) expand your self !!! push harder than Basic, Intermediate.  This projects are set up more properly for real world and possibly starting an open source projects !  Here, we are more concerned with software engineering principles, project structure, testability, etc.
* [hello-luke-java-git](https://github.com/nalbarr/hello-luke-java-git)
* [hello-luke-java-threads-git]
* [hello-luke-java-postgres-git]
* [hello-luke-csharp-git]
* [hello-luke-python-git]
* [hello-luke-fsharp.git](https://github.com/nalbarr/hello-luke-fsharp)

This one we did together so you can learn how basic web apps work with HTML5 and simple web server.
* [hello-luke-python-flask](https://github.com/nalbarr/hello-luke-python-flask.git)

### Co-creation - i.e,. (1 + 1 > 2) !!!
(NLA) I am not taking full credit for these.  We did these together !!!  After a time, I realize we were learning more togethers as a team versus me "teaching" you.  Also, these were great refreshers for me.

* [hello-luke-cljs](https://github.com/nalbarr/hello-luke-cljs)
* [hello-luke-haskell](https://github.com/nalbarr/hello-luke-haskell)

### Go pro, Advanced Topics
(NLA) you get here, then you know you are really good.  Define your own path.

#### What the world wants and needs - Cognitive / AI experts !!!
(NLA) Cognitive is about a partnership between humans and machines.  Really it is about that humans learns and machines learn and now we will find it hard to know the difference when we do every day tasks.

Do not get too distracted with only the "Data Science" hype as intersection between CS, Math/Statistics, and a Business/Domain.  It is definitely what is hot but I think those that understand that PLUS cognitive / AI will be the future technology leaders. Think of it as building "learning systems" or "systems that learn".  Also, your generation may even be doing quantum by the time you finish university.  

Here are some foundational courses I found useful for me to learn fast about it.  The world moves fast and you may never really be an expert at anything but it does not means you can not learn fast and possibly faster than the main stream.  

You can refer to below.  I either completed the courses are audited the pieces that were necessary for industry projects, mentoring and teaching.  I hope you build your own list over time.  There is too much in the world to learn.

* IBM Cloud

I will update projects as we pair and as I hear things you are interested that may help in the overall journey.  So much to learn together !!!

## Pedagogy and Context
There have been 6 major evolutions in the NLA/NA pairing in reverse chronological order.  I keep notes because I am so interested in how your are learning and how I had to "unlearn" many of my biases in order mentor you.  What I thought was cool - may have not been for you.  Possibly, pairing is really co-creation and learning together.

### 2019
- Fall.  Prep for CS + X program !!!
- Spring.  Computer Science Club.  NLA continues on his own learning path and enjoys learning and teaching other students and mastering his own school CS class.  Last time I checked, he ported a more classic Java based program into Clojure to see how concise he could make it.  NLA also experiments with doing some entrepreneurship work in Swift with class mates.
- (Pre) Summer.  NLA wants more entry into concepts such as: concurrency/multi-threading, databases

### 2018
- Fall.  Computer Science Club.  NLA goes for more leadership and teachers others.  Sees more opportunity to build tools to help other students interested in CS because he observes "he understands how modern generation learns and what makes a good programmer".  Going deep on Clojure, Rust !!!  Independent projects - ...
- Summer.  Independent Projects.  Explore "7 Languages in 7 weeks".  Exposure to both VM post UIC EVL, KL - Loyola University.  Explore Scala, Clojure.  VM/NLA - 3D printing project.
- Spring.  Computer Science - AP. Java, Python?, Spring project, mentoring other students.

### 2017
- Fall.  Computer Science - AP. Java, Python?, Experimentation with Unity/C#/Game Engine, mentoring other students.  VM internship #2.

### 2016 
- Summer.  Exposure to VM and UIC EVL, Cave, Unity, Virtual Reality.  Understanding research and the scientific method.

### 2015
- Spring.  Computer science - Intro.  Java.
- Fall - Experimental projects (C#, Python) - Simple syntax, attempt at 2D games (e.g., tic tac toe)

### < 2014?
- Spring - Scratch - Intro.
