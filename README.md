hello-luke-java

This is project dedicated for NA/NLA pairing and guiding NLA in his learning as he ventures past K-12 and towards university.

## Goals
* 

## Guidelines
(NLA)  
This is your "anchor project".  Other projects are used to support learning here and eventually you will move in parallel, once you have a strong core and foundations.  To start, we will adventure using Java as a core base language and compare and contrast two other language C# and Python.

These are at:
* [hello-luke-java](https://github.com/nalbarr/hello-luke-java "Java anchor project")

* [hello-luke-csharp](https://github.com/nalbarr/hello-luke-csharp "C# analog project")

* [hello-luke-python](https://github.com/nalbarr/hello-luke-python "Python analog project")

I will update projects as we pair and as I hear thing that may help in the overall journey.

## Tools, etc.
We will start all exercises very simple with projects based on a console program, simple main() entry point before introducing too much other "stuff".

However, the goal is to get your exposure and fluent with leading edge methods and tools over time.

## Pedagogy and Context
There have been 4 major evolutions in NLA/NA pairing in reverse chronological order.

__2017__
Fall - Computer Science - AP. Java, Python?, Experimentation with Unity/C#/Game Engine, mentoring other students

__2016__ 
Summer.  Exposure to VM and UIC EVL, Cave, Unity, Virtual Reality

__2015__
Spring.  Computer science - Intro.  Java.
Fall - Experimental projects (C#, Python) - Simple syntax, attempt a 2D games

__Before 2014?__
2014. Spring - Scratch - Intro.
