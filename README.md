# hello-luke-java
This is project dedicated for NA/NLA pairing and guiding NLA in his learning as he ventures past K-12 and towards university.

## Goals
* (NLA) we should define goals, without goals we can not measure progress.

## Guidelines
(NLA)  
This is your "anchor project".  Other projects are used to support learning here and eventually you will move in parallel, once you have a strong core and foundations.  To start, we will adventure using Java as a core base language and compare and contrast two other language C# and Python.

I am dividing them into 3 categories: 1) basic, 2) advanced, 3) go pro

### Basic
These projects are based on what we explore step by step, question by question and not specifically directed but show your personal journey and evolution.

* [hello-luke-java](https://github.com/nalbarr/hello-luke-java "Java anchor project")

* [hello-luke-csharp](https://github.com/nalbarr/hello-luke-csharp "C# analog project")

* [hello-luke-python](https://github.com/nalbarr/hello-luke-python "Python analog project")

### Intermediate
You may find these handy.  This are katas I like to use when learning a new language and helps
distinguish specific programming language characteristics (e.g., static vs. dynamic/intepreted, strong and weak typing).  Note a small stepping point to Scala as a hybrid OO and functional language. I added some puzzles we have worked through together.

* [hello-shapes-java](https://github.com/nalbarr/hello-shapes-java "Java shapes project")

* [hello-shapes-csharp] TBD.

* [hello-shapes-python](https://github.com/nalbarr/hello-shapes-python "Python shapes project")

* [hello-shapes-scala](https://github.com/nalbarr/hello-shapes-scala "Scala shapes project")

* [hello-shapes-clj](https://github.com/nalbarr/hello-shapes-clj "Clojure shapes project")

* [luke-eistein-puzzle-R](https://github.com/nalbarr/luke-einstein-puzzle-R)

### Advanced
(NLA) expand your self !!! push harder than Basic, Intermediate.  This projects are set up more properly for real world and possibly starting an open source projects !  Here, we are more concerned with software engineering principles, project structure, testability, etc.
* [hello-luke-java-git]
* [hello-luke-csharp-git]
* [hello-luke-python-git]

This one we did together so you can learn how basic web apps work with HTML5 and simple web server.
* [hello-luke-python-flask](https://github.com/nalbarr/hello-luke-python-flask.git)

### Co-creation - i.e,. (1 + 1 > 2) !!!
(NLA) I am not taking full credit for these.  We did these more together.  After a time, I realize we were learning more togethers as a team versus me "teaching" you.  Also, these were great refreshers for me.

* [hello-luke-cljs] (https://github.com/nalbarr/hello-luke-cljs)
* [hello-luke-haskell] (https://github.com/nalbarr/hello-luke-haskell)

### Go pro
(NLA) you get here, then you know you are really good.
* [hello-luke-unity-git]
* [hello-luke-python-ai-git]
* [hello-luke-unity-ai-git]
* [hello-shapes-blazor] (https://github.com/nalbarr/hello-shapes-blazor)

I will update projects as we pair and as I hear thing that may help in the overall journey.

## Tools, etc.
We will start all exercises very simple with projects based on a console program, simple main() entry point before introducing too much other "stuff".

However, the goal is to get your exposure and fluent with leading edge methods and tools over time.

## Pedagogy and Context
There have been 6 major evolutions in NLA/NA pairing in reverse chronological order.

__2018__
Fall.  Computer Science Club.  NLA goes for more leadership and teachers others.  Sees more opportunity to build tools to help other students interested in CS because he observes "he understands how modern generation learns and what makes a good programmer".
Summer.  Independent Projects.  Explore "7 Languages in 7 weeks".  Exposure to both VM post UIC EVL, KL - Loyola University.  Explore Scala, Clojure.  VM/NLA - 3D printing project.
Spring.  Computer Science - AP. Java, Python?, Spring project, mentoring other students.

__2017__
Fall.  Computer Science - AP. Java, Python?, Experimentation with Unity/C#/Game Engine, mentoring other students.

__2016__ 
Summer.  Exposure to VM and UIC EVL, Cave, Unity, Virtual Reality.  Understanding research and scientific method.

__2015__
Spring.  Computer science - Intro.  Java.
Fall - Experimental projects (C#, Python) - Simple syntax, attempt a 2D games

__Before 2014?__
2014. Spring - Scratch - Intro.
